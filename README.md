# SDG_DIETPLANNER

SDG Diet Planner is a web-based application that helps users plan healthy, affordable, and sustainable meals aligned with the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), especially SDG 2 (Zero Hunger) and SDG 3 (Good Health and Well-being). The planner encourages diverse food choices, reduced food waste, and environmentally conscious eating habits.​

Features
Personalized meal plans based on age, gender, activity level, dietary preferences, and health goals.

SDG-aware recommendations that highlight how each meal supports goals like Zero Hunger, Good Health and Well-being, Responsible Consumption and Production, and Climate Action.​

Dietary diversity tracking using simple food groups (grains, pulses, fruits, vegetables, animal products, etc.) to promote balanced nutrition.​

Basic nutrition estimates (calories and key macro groups) with simple visual feedback.

Food-waste and sustainability tips, including guidance on portion control, seasonal produce, and low-impact ingredients.​

Progress dashboard with weekly summaries of diet quality and SDG contribution.

Project Goals
Promote awareness of how daily food choices connect to the SDGs and global challenges like hunger, malnutrition, and climate change.​

Support users in building healthier, more diverse diets while remaining sensitive to affordability and local food availability.​

Provide a simple educational tool for students, teachers, and communities to explore sustainable diets.

Architecture / Tech Stack
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (or your chosen framework such as React / Vue).

Backend: Node.js / Express or any preferred backend framework.

Database: MongoDB / PostgreSQL (or another DB) to store user profiles, meal plans, and food items.

Optional integrations: Open food/nutrition APIs for nutrient data and local datasets for region-specific foods.

Update this section to match your actual implementation details.

Getting Started
Clone the repository:
git clone <repository-url>

Install dependencies in the backend and frontend folders:
npm install

Create an environment file (e.g., .env) with database connection strings and any API keys.

Run the development server(s):

Backend: npm run dev

Frontend: npm start

Open the app in your browser and create a user profile to begin generating plans.

Usage
Create a profile with basic information (age, gender, height, weight, activity level).

Select dietary preferences and restrictions (e.g., vegetarian, vegan, allergies).

Generate a daily or weekly meal plan and review the SDG impact and diversity score.

Adjust meals, mark eaten/uneaten items, and track your progress over time.

SDG Alignment
The SDG Diet Planner mainly supports:

SDG 2 – Zero Hunger: Encourages diverse, nutritious food choices and awareness of undernourishment and food insecurity.​

SDG 3 – Good Health and Well-being: Promotes healthier diets to reduce non-communicable diseases and malnutrition.​

SDG 12 – Responsible Consumption and Production: Highlights food waste reduction and responsible purchasing.​

SDG 13, 14, 15 – Climate & Ecosystems: Encourages diets with lower environmental footprints, such as more plant-based options.​

You can expand this section with specific indicators or classroom use-cases.

Roadmap
More detailed nutrient breakdown and micronutrient tracking.

Localization (languages, regional foods, and cultural dishes).

Gamification features (badges for diversity, low waste, SDG streaks).

Integration with mobile apps or wearable devices.
